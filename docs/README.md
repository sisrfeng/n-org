# Bug Reports
Oh no, did something break? See [here](/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-a-bug-or-issue) to find out how to report it and the steps to take

# Contribution
All the things you will need to know are described [right here](/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#formatting-rules). So go ahead and make something already! :P

# Creating Modules
Now's the fun part, you gotta learn how the module system works and how to program for it! A mini walkthrough is available in the [Creating Modules](https://github.com/vhyrro/neorg/wiki/Creating-Modules) document
in the wiki.

# The Future
Want to know what's brewing up behind the scenes? Take a look at the [written roadmap](/doc/roadmap.norg) (or do `:h neorg-roadmap` in neovim) to see where we're headed!
